Razer Synapse is our unified configuration software that allows you to rebind controls or assign macros to any of your Razer peripherals and saves all your settings automatically to the cloud. No more tedious device configurations when you arrive at LAN parties or tourneys, as you can pull them from the cloud, and get owning right away.

* **Stats &amp; Heatmaps**: Track all your in-game clicks, movements and more as you put your peripherals through the paces with Razer Synapse Stats &amp; Heatmaps and analyze your gameplay with the help of automatically generated heatmaps. And no worries, stats tracking is entirely optional.
