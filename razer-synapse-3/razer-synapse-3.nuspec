* **ALL-NEW USER EXPERIENCE**: _Redesigned for ease-of-use._ Redesigned from the ground up with a refreshing interface and modular installation capabilities, Razer Synapse 3 features a revamped dashboard with easy access to your device configurator, macro configurator, warranty registration and more.
* **ADVANCED MACRO CAPABILITIES**: _For extended power combos._ Bring powerful macros to your favorite games with Razer Synapse 3. Easily create a string of complex button presses, and then precisely execute game-winning combinations with a single click.
* **ALL-NEW RAZER HYPERSHIFT**: _For increased button control._ Simply press a single button to temporarily unlock a secondary set of functions on top of your existing button assignments, effectively doubling the number of customizable buttons on your device.
* **NEXT GEN CHROMA STUDIO**: _For advanced Razer Chroma™ capabilities._ Make your desk a canvas with the all-new advanced lighting config tool that allows you to create various lighting effects and synchronize across multiple devices, while following the exact placement of your devices on your desktop.
